## About Me

I'm a developer with a strong interest in automation, AI-powered applications, and creatively engineered solutions. My projects range from AI-driven assistants to optimized cloud-based workflows. I enjoy working on practical applications that blend machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and automation to improve everyday tasks.

## Projects

- **Tech Stack**: AWS, Docker, Firebase, Express.js, nginx, Next.js, JS/TS, TailwindCSS
- Created ATPhoto, a photography portfolio site with automated gallery and blog generation for seamless content management
- Designed a secure backend with Express.js and Firebase, implemented a CI/CD pipeline (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, EC2), and optimized performance with nginx, CloudFront, and Route53 (22x faster load times)

### [Cook-Buddy](https://github.com/DarrelFW321/Cook-Buddy) ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-WvIjfFc7Q))

- **Tech Stack**: Llama 3.1, Unsloth, OpenAI, Flask, Python, Google Cloud, JS, HTML/CSS
- Developed Cook-Buddy, an AI-powered cooking assistant that provides recipe recommendations based on ingredients
- Optimized Llama 3.1 fine-tuning with LoRA on Unsloth (120% faster, 70% less VRAM) and classified 2.23M recipes 40x faster with OpenAIâ€™s Batch API

### [ProportionAl](https://github.com/enxilium/proportion) ([website](https://proportionai.xyz))

- **Tech Stack**: AWS, Terraform, Docker, MongoDB, Next.js, REST APIs, JS/TS, Gemini API
- Built a full-stack productivity app in Next.js with secure Auth0 login for an AI-powered personalized experience, and REST APIs for CRUD operations with MongoDB
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and deployment using Terraform and AWS, reducing DevOps overhead by 10x

### [Marble Mania](https://github.com/m3di0cre3/MarbleMania) ([demo](https://2ly.link/23DHq))

- **Tech Stack**: Python, C++, Arduino
- Created a physical rhythm game inspired by osu!mania, with marbles on ramps simulating falling notes
- Used an Arduino microcontroller to operate servos and send sensor-tracked scores to a Pygame display


## Interests & Focus Areas

Machine Learning & AI: Building practical AI tools, fine-tuning models, and developing my own models.

DevOps: Automating deployments and maintaining sound infrastructure.

Fullstack Applications: Building practical applications using a variety of technologies and being willing to have a crazy flow chart. Being scared of a complicated workflow can really hold you back.
